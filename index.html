                Small Pizzas. R70.00 . Our par-baked pizza bases are crispy and delicious. We use A-grade steak
                and
                quality chicken breast fillets for the topping.

                The medium pizza is usually a 12-in. circle, whereas a standard large pizza is a 14-in. circle. It
                seems
                like you’ll have nearly twice as much pizza for roughly the same price if you order two mediums.

                large pizza is cut into eight slices and will serve two or three people. You’re going to have way
